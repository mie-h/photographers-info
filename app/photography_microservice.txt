Description:
=============
Your assignment is to create a microservice which serves the contents of photographers.json through a REST API.

The service should expose three REST endpoints:

* GET /api/photographers - returns the list of all photographers.
	return [id, first, last, username, phone num, avatar, event types]
* GET /api/photographers/{photographerID} - returns a single photographer by ID.
	return id, first, last, username, phone num, avatar, event types
* GET /api/photographers/event/{eventType} - returns a list of photographers for the specified event type.
	return [id, first, last, username, phone num, avatar]

Examples of event_types:
* wedding
* birthdays
* wildlife
* sports

The above APIs should only return high-level characteristics of the photographer data. For example - name, contact, avatar, event_types etc.

Please create unit tests that cover the core logic.

With time permitting, package the application for distribution. Some examples of this:
* Docker image (preferred)
* Tomcat WAR
* Static binary
